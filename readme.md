# Trifold character sheets for Dungeon Crawl Classics
A set of character sheets for the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG.

## Contents
* `0level/` contains the code to generate 0-level character sheets, 4 per page.
* `trifold/` contains the code to generate trifold-pamphlet-style character sheets for each class. It will also generate a `*-noflip` version for easier reading.
## Usage
In
`sh make.sh` to build the class sheets. This also builds a -noflip version which should be easier to read but won't print correctly.
