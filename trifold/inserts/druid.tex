    \textbf{Weapon training}: Druids can use any weapon or armor they choose, however using weapons or armor made of metal causes them to use their \textit{call of the animal}, \textit{woodland stride}, and \textit{animal shape} abilities for 24 hours. \\
    \textbf{Call of the animal}: Druids can channel the savagery of nature into their being. Making a personality roll, a druid can call an animal spirit into their body for relevant bonuses. \\

    \textbf{Natural lore}: Druids can identify flora and fauna with ease, and if water is clean and safe to drink. With an INT check, they can tell the weather for the next 12 hours. \\
    \textbf{Natural weapons}: Given materials, druids can construct weapons from stone, wood, and bone. \\
    \textbf{Woodland stride}: Druids can move through natural obstructions such as brambles or thick branches as if they were water. A druid will take no damage from such obstacles, and does not leave tracks. \\
    \textbf{Animal shape}: Druids can cast the animal shape spell using 1d20+level+PER. They cannot spellburn, but can suffer from corruption and misfire. \\
