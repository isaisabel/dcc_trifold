\classheader{Witch}{
    \textbf{Weapon training}: Witches are trained in the use of the dagger, javelin, lance, longbow, longsword, shortbow, shortsword, staff, spear, and two-handed sword. Witches often wear armor, even though it affects their spellcasting. \\
    \textbf{Magic}: Witches cast spells by making a spell check. A witch's spell check is usually 1d20 + intelligence modifier + level. \\
    \textbf{Channeled magic}: Witches can channel magic into physical augmentations. Channeled spells are drawn from the mutation lists from MCC, and do not require verbal or material components nor have mercurial effects. Witches can gain a number of passive channeled spells equal to their max spell level. \\
    \textbf{Spellburn}: Witches may sacrifice ability scores for bonuses to spell checks. For every ability point they expend, the witch adds +1 to their spell check. Ability scores lost in this way return at a rate of 1 per day that spellburn has not been inflicted. Other sacrifices can also net casting bonuses, at a rate of +1 per 500gp. \\
